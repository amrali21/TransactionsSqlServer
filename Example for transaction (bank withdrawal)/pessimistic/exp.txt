this transaction checks is there is enough balance then withdraws amount from bank account.

- the transaction starts with an update statement to aquire an exclusive lock on the row to prevent read or write and prevent inconsistency.
- next step is to check if balance is enough after withdrawal. if it is the transaction commits. if not, it rolls back.
- if you try to run 2 sessions of this transaction in parallel, the first session to start the update statement will complete first.

notes:
- transaction isolation level is read committed, but any other pessimistic isolation level will work in this case because they all aquire exclusive lock on update.
