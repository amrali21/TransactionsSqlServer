snapshot isolation level
 - reads are got from latest commited version in the version store but it does not see data comitted after transaction started.
 - writes: if a snapshot transaction started then a sql statement tried to update data that was updated in the snapshot transaction, the sql statement is rolledback with 3960.
 - [TEST]: try editing data locked by this transaction.  < = = =

read committed snapshot.
 - writes: same write behaviour as read committed (aquires U and X locks on the row)
 - reads: get last comitted value from version store instead of aquiring shared lock.
 - this vs read-uncommitted mode: this does not read un-committed data.
